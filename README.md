# EDF-forest-mgmt

This project is the result of a partnership between the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and the UC Santa Barabara Environmental Markets Lab (emLab) aimed braodly at identifying market and non-market mechanisms that can help increase the pace and scale of forest management in California. It is a continuation of previous [work](https://woodwisegp.weebly.com/deliverables.html) done by masters students at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Managment that sought to calculate the marginal cost of carbon abatement/sequestration via forest management in the state. This project expands on that previous work by also considering the impact of management on avoided fire emissions. 

Our analysis relies on the USFS model [BioSum](http://biosum.info/) which uses the USFS Forest Vegetation Simulator as a backbone for calcuting the cost and carbon consequences of forest management practices.
